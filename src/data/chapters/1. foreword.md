These pages are a summary of the content found on Naval's podcast and his website. 

But they are my summaries and thus my interpretations. I took out what I thought would summarise it best.. for me. I left out a few bits, such as 'set as aspirational hourly rate', which I found hard and weird to apply. So if you want to dive deeper, please have a look into the original podcast and post.

# For the nerds and tool-lovers:

- **Writing**: Notion, Hemingway, Grammerly
- **Coding**: Visual studio code
- **Design**: Figma
- **Other:** Google, Stack overflow and sometimes my ðŸ§ 

## Tech stack:

- [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org/)
- [Netlify](https://netlify.com)
- [Github (source code)](https://github.com/flowen/principlesofwealth)

Design took around ~5 hours. 

Development took around 25 hours.

Writing, interpreting, listening, grammar and spelling corrections time took me approximately 40 hours (but I didn't log this).
