These pages are a summary of the content found on Naval's podcast and his website. 

But they are my summaries and thus my interpretations. I took out what I thought would summarise it best.. for me. I left out a few bits, such as 'set as aspirational hourly rate', which I found hard and weird to apply. So if you want to dive deeper, please have a look into the original podcast and post.

For the nerds and tool-lovers:

- Notion to manage todo's and write
- Hemingway app for conciseness and grammarly for spellchecks
- Visual studio code
- Figma
- Google, Stack overflow and sometimes my ðŸ§ 

Tech stack:

- Gatsby
- Netlify
- Github (source code)

Design took around ~4-5 hours. 

Development took around hours.

Writing, interpreting, listening, grammar and spelling corrections time took me around 50 hours.

Please contact me on twitter for any questions, corrections, suggestions or any other *-tions.
