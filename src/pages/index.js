    <h1>Principles of wealth.net</h1>
    <h2>A summary of Naval Ravikant’s tweetstorms and podcast</h2>

    <p>
      This site is a summary of Naval's famous podcast 'how to get rich'. Which started out as
      several tweetstorms, the podcast dove deep into each tweet.{' '}

      faster.{' '}
